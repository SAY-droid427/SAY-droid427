### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Sayani Mallick, a full-stack web developer (MERN stack) , a competitive programmer and an aspiring animation artist.I am an Open Souurce enthusiast.I am currently an Electronics And Communication Engineering student in BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus. I am a competitive coder and love to code in C++. I am currently trying to venture into the world of open source.  I love solving logical problems,puzzles and brain games. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a plethora of projects on web development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VueJS,Mobile development using React Native  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects,mainly on Javascript and its frameworks.I would also love to contribute to any repository of data structures and algorithms.

I am trying to encourage women in technology and trying to guide a few of my fellow mates into the world of programming.I have therefore, created a git repository, which contains roadmaps for full stack web development.This also contains resources like articles and video tutorial links that I found useful while learning web development. I have also created a repository for data structures and algorithms, which contain almost all the basic data structures that I have come across on my journey to study data structures and algorithms. I am looking forward to collaborations and contributions for enriching the repository.
