### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Sayani Mallick, a full-stack web developer (MERN stack) , a competitive programmer and an aspiring animation artist.I am an Open Souurce enthusiast.I am currently an Electronics And Communication Engineering student in BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus. I am a competitive coder and love to code in C++. I am currently trying to venture into the world of open source.  I love solving logical problems,puzzles and brain games. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a plethora of projects on web development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning docker and devops

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects,mainly on Javascript and its frameworks.I would also love to contribute to any repository of data structures and algorithms.

I believe that there is  a great need for women to be more involved in tech. To get women more interested in tech, I have tried to make resources more easily available to women. Check out ["Women in Tech"](https://say-droid427.github.io/women_in_tech.html) to find out the amazing opportunities available for women in tech. This website also includes an exhaustive list of free courses available to upskill yourself in any tech stack you wish to!
I am trying to encourage women in technology and trying to guide a few of my fellow mates into the world of programming.I have therefore, created a git repository, which contains roadmaps for full stack web development.This also contains resources like articles and video tutorial links that I found useful while learning web development. I have also created a repository for data structures and algorithms, which contain almost all the basic data structures that I have come across on my journey to study data structures and algorithms. I am looking forward to collaborations and contributions for enriching the repository.
